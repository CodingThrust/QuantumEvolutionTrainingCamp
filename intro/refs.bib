  abstract = {Optical tweezer arrays have had a transformative impact on atomic and molecular physics over the past years, and they now form the backbone for a wide range of leading experiments in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology. Typical experiments trap tens to hundreds of atomic qubits, and very recently systems with around one thousand atoms were realized without demonstrating coherent control. However, scaling to thousands of atomic qubits with long coherence times and low-loss, high-fidelity imaging is an outstanding challenge and critical for progress in quantum computing, simulation, and metrology, in particular, towards applications with quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally realize an array of optical tweezers trapping over 6,100 neutral atoms in around 12,000 sites while simultaneously surpassing state-of-the-art performance for several critical metrics that underpin the success of the platform. Specifically, while scaling to such a large number of atoms, we also demonstrate a coherence time of 12.6(1) seconds, a record for hyperfine qubits in an optical tweezer array. Further, we show trapping lifetimes close to 23 minutes in a room-temperature apparatus, enabling record-high imaging survival of 99.98952(1)\% in combination with an imaging fidelity of over 99.99\%. We lay out a detailed, near-term plan to enable zone-based quantum computing with \${\textbackslash}sim\$6,000 atoms, and demonstrate a crucial ingredient thereof: coherent moves of up to 610 \${\textbackslash}mu\$m with a fidelity of \${\textbackslash}sim\$99.95\%, as characterized through interleaved randomized benchmarking. Our results, together with other recent developments, indicate that universal quantum computing with ten thousand atomic qubits could be a near-term prospect. Furthermore, our work could pave the way for quantum simulation and metrology experiments with inherent single particle readout and positioning capabilities at a similar scale.},

  abstract = {Rydberg atoms with principal quantum number n{$\NestedGreaterGreater$}1 have exaggerated atomic properties including dipole-dipole interactions that scale as n4 and radiative lifetimes that scale as n3. It was proposed a decade ago to take advantage of these properties to implement quantum gates between neutral atom qubits. The availability of a strong long-range interaction that can be coherently turned on and off is an enabling resource for a wide range of quantum information tasks stretching far beyond the original gate proposal. Rydberg enabled capabilities include long-range two-qubit gates, collective encoding of multiqubit registers, implementation of robust light-atom quantum interfaces, and the potential for simulating quantum many-body physics. The advances of the last decade are reviewed, covering both theoretical and experimental aspects of Rydberg-mediated quantum information processing.},
